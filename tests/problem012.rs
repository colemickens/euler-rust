/*
Problem 012

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.
So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.
The first ten terms would be:
      1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
   1: 1
   3: 1,3
   6: 1,2,3,6
  10: 1,2,5,10
  15: 1,3,5,15
  21: 1,3,7,21
  28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

/*
28 = 2 * 2 * 7
28 has six factors: 1, 2, 7, (2*2), (7*2), (7*2*2)

28 / 2^x + 7^y : remainder of 0
-------------------------------
28 / 2^0 + 7^0 : remainder of 0
28 / 2^1 + 7^0 : remainder of 0
28 / 2^2 + 7^0 : remainder of 0
28 / 2^0 + 7^1 : remainder of 0
28 / 2^1 + 7^1 : remainder of 0
28 / 2^2 + 7^1 : remainder of 0

So y varies between the potential values of 7^y, since 7 can be a factor of 28 zero or once. (1, 7)
x vaires between the potential values of 2^x, which can appear as a factor zero, one or two times (1, 2, 4)

So then it's (3 choose 1) * (2 choose 1) == (3 * 2) == 6
