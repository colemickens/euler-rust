# Euler Problems

Solution to some [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.

Problems #1 through #12 were solved, skipping #11, but only #1 through #4 are ported to `nightly`.

## Rust & Cargo Version

This currently targets a `nightly` build of rust.
Specifically:

```
rustc 1.2.0-nightly (31d9aee68 2015-06-22)
cargo 0.3.0-nightly (87b5bfd 2015-06-21) (built 2015-06-21)
```

I highly recommend the use of multirust to keep your various `rust` toolchains separated cleanly.

## Testing

```
cargo build
cargo test
```

Expected output:

```
[coming shortly]
```
